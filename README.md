# Memorizer

This application was made mainly to demonstrate abilities of Flutter framework and its comparison to the native Android.

**Budget: ~20 hours of work.**

## Application UI

* select a category of animals
* go into the detail page and press the floating button
* select number of animals that will appear in the test and press START
* at the end of the test, the number of correct answers will show up
* supported languages: Latin, English, Czech

### Application flow

## Architecture

* tried to use Bloc pattern; only for fetching categories, though
* used `SharedPreferences` to store language settings
* all data is static (for now), stored in JSON file in the assets
* images are taken from `Flickr api`

## TODO

* more animals
* more features :-) 
* configure AWS database that will store metadata
* add/edit new images and translations using AWS and flickr API
